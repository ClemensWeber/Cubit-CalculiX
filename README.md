# Cubit-CalculiX
Hey ho thatÂ´s the CalculiX plugin for coreform cubit!

Here you can find the source code and a build for linux.
If you want to build the plugin yourself, i would recommend using Centos 7.
As far as i know, that's the distro on which cubit is build.
This plugin was tested with Cubit 2022.4 on Ubuntu 22.04

# Upcoming soon
I am currently working on a deeper integration of calculix to cubit. So that a complete model definition can be done with cubit.
When the alpha is ready i will release it here.

# Installation

copy the **libcalculix_plugin.so** into the plugins directory, that you can find in your Cubit installation directory.

e.g.: /opt/Coreform-Cubit-2022.4/bin/plugins/

Features:
- adds an export option for the use with CalculiX
- supported element types: see listing below 
- supports export of nodesets and sidesets
- supports export of materials and section properties

How to use:
- command 'export ccx "filename"' for export of the mesh
- command 'ccx print core' to print out data from the core, mainly useful for development
- command 'ccx log core' to print out data from the core to the logfile, mainly useful for development
- command 'ccx version' to print out the plugin version
- command 'ccx block <block id>... element_type <ccx element type>' set the ccx element type to a block

# material and section properties export:
Use the Cubit-Abaqus Card to define the material.

Supported Material Properties:
 - youngs modulus
 - poisson's ratio
 - yield stress vs. strain vs. temperature

The thickness for plain strain and stress elements is defined with block attribute 1

The thickness for shells is defined with block attribute 1, the offset with block attribute 2
